# Minesweeper

## 1. Pomodoro

- I created the files and fill out the documents. The drawborad function is done.

## 2-3. Pomodoro

- It can check the winner and clear the empty fields.

## 4. Pomodoro

- It shows the number of the bombs.

## 5. Pomodoro

- The flad and the step functions are done.

## 6-7. Pomodoro

- I created the minesweeper function what is the main function. I had to modify the drawborad function becaues it does not have to show every value.
